## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HARIHARANS24/logistic-heart-predictor.git
cd logistic-heart-predictor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Input the required clinical features:
   - Age
   - Sex
   - Chest pain type
   - Resting blood pressure
   - Cholesterol
   - Fasting blood sugar
   - Resting ECG results
   - Maximum heart rate
   - Exercise-induced angina
   - ST depression
   - Slope of peak exercise ST segment
   - Number of major vessels
   - Thalassemia

4. Click "Predict" to get the heart disease prediction

## 📊 Model Details

The project uses Logistic Regression for binary classification to predict the presence or absence of heart disease. The model is trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset and includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics calculation
